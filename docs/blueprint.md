# **App Name**: Campus Pulse

## Core Features:

- Event Listing: Display upcoming college events in a chronologically ordered list with details such as time, location, description, and registration links.
- Registration Form Links: Provide direct links to event registration forms for each listed event. Links must open in a new tab.
- Event Filtering and Search: Allow users to filter events by category (e.g., sports, academic, social) and search by keyword to find specific events of interest.
- Admin Event Creation: Enable administrators to create and manage events through a secure, password-protected interface, including adding details and registration links.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) for a modern, serious look on dark surfaces.
- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) providing a sleek, dark backdrop that makes content pop. Should be very desaturated relative to primary color.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE4BFE) for CTAs and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used because of its readability and neutral appearance that is versatile for both headers and body text.
- Use minimalist, glowing icons to represent event categories (e.g., a book for academic events, a ball for sports). 
- Implement a modern 'glassmorphism' effect (frosted glass) for content containers, achieved with transparency, blur, and subtle shadows, which brings a frosted glass appearance, combined with dark black backgrounds, and elements with subtly contrasting lighter darks to simulate reflections on the 'glass'.
- Incorporate subtle hover animations on event listings and buttons, creating an engaging, interactive user experience. For example, icons could slightly enlarge, registration buttons glow, or events slide
